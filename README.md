# Refresher
Code to help me get refreshed on text based programming.
I have currently been programming for Labview for about a year.  I've noticed that my ability to code in text based languages has declined.

This repository is for me to work on some of the fundamentals of programming such as:
  Simple Architecture,
  Simple Data Structures,
  Simple Algorithms,
  OOP,
  Etc....
The goal for this repository is to GIT me back on track
